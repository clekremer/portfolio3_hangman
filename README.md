### Automated testing
I used my school Code Institutes own validator https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ to check the code automated. I tested run.py, words.py, word_art.py and hangman_stages.py and the code had no errors or warnings in it.

## Deployment
 The app was deployed through Heroku. The steps are as following:

1. Create new app in Heroku
2. Add unique name for the app and select Europe as region and click "Create app".
3. In settings add buildpacks for `Python` and `NodeJS`(Config_vars were not required for the game.).
4. In "Deploy-Tab" select GitHub as deployment method and connect the Github repository with Heroku
5. For the initial deployment I used manual deployment; afterwards I enabled automatic deployment. So deployment happens automatically with the execution of every "git push" command.
